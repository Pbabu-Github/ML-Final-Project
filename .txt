- drwaw confusion matrix from scratch by  using phils stuff
- see how to balance ofut data while training for drugs bc it s84 percent of the data
- see if we can train by our own logistic regression
- auditing error analysis


Notes
- Model Auditing / Error Analysis	Compute and visualize precision/recall per class. Where does it fail most?
- 	Compare with Random Forest	Test a stronger classifier on the same preprocessed data.
- Train Your Own Logistic Model (Torch)	Use the logistic.py you showed earlier. Train it and compare performance to sklearn.
- 	Plot Training Loss for Your Model	From the Torch logistic model, record and plot loss curve (like in your blogs).
- Hyperparameter Tuning	Try adjusting class weights, learning rates, etc.
- 	Final Evaluation & Auditing	Plot updated confusion matrix + F1 scores per class. Maybe even a "top misclassified" analysis.
- 	Blog/report ready	Assemble your code, results, and reflections into your final deliverable (like previous blogs).
