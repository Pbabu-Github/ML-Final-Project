# Machine learning Final Project Proposal

## Abstract
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally. This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a person developing heart disease based on key health indicators such as age, cholesterol level, chest pain type, and blood pressure. The approach involves using logistic regression as a baseline and comparing its performance against a Random Forest classifier to better capture feature interactions. Evaluation will be conducted using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics to ensure the model's effectiveness and clinical relevance.

## Motivation and Question
My motivation stems from the significant potential of predictive healthcare technologies to transform preventative care. By accurately identifying at-risk individuals, healthcare providers can intervene early, greatly improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. The primary scientific question is: **Can we reliably predict the risk of heart disease using easily accessible clinical data?**

## Data Plan
The data used for this project will be sourced from the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset available on Kaggle and the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains clinical records including factors such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, and blood pressure.

## Planned Deliverables
### Primary Deliverables:
- A well-documented Python package containing:
  - Data preprocessing pipeline
  - Implementation of logistic regression and random forest models
  - Evaluation scripts using standard classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)

- Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Model training and hyperparameter tuning
  - Results analysis and feature importance visualization

### Evaluation:
- **Full Success:** A robust predictive model that reliably predicts heart disease risk with an ROC-AUC score above 0.85, demonstrating clear interpretability of important features.
- **Partial Success:** Even if the ideal ROC-AUC is not reached, deliverables will include a fully functional and interpretable modeling pipeline, providing valuable insights into the key health indicators influencing heart disease.

## Resources Required
- **Data:** Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle.
- **Software:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
- **Computing Resources:** Personal computer sufficient for moderate computational demands of this project.
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub will be used extensively for version tracking, collaboration, and documentation management.

## What I Will Learn
Through this project, I aim to learn:
- Advanced classification techniques (Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression)
- Techniques for effective exploratory data analysis and feature engineering
- Evaluation methodologies for binary classifiers (ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Git version control for effective project management
- Effective documentation and reproducible research practices

## Risk Statement
Potential risks include:
1. **Data Limitations:** The Cleveland dataset might lack sufficient complexity or diversity, potentially limiting model generalizability.
2. **Performance Constraints:** Random Forest may not significantly outperform Logistic Regression if key predictors interact linearly, limiting the added value from more complex modeling techniques.

Contingency plans involve extensive exploratory analysis to mitigate data limitations and clearly document any constraints encountered.

## Ethics Statement
### Potential Beneficiaries:
- Individuals at risk of heart disease due to better early diagnosis and treatment.
- Healthcare providers, through improved predictive tools for patient care.

### Potential Risks:
- **Exclusion:** Individuals whose data characteristics differ significantly from the dataset may not benefit equally, potentially reinforcing biases in healthcare access.
- **Harm:** Incorrect predictions could cause unnecessary anxiety or false reassurance. Hence, careful communication of model limitations is crucial.

The assumption behind the project's beneficial impact is that early prediction and intervention lead to improved healthcare outcomes. Another assumption is that predictive modeling based on existing clinical data reliably translates into real-world benefits.

## Tentative Timeline
### Week 9 (Checkpoint - Week 11):
- Complete initial exploratory data analysis and preprocessing pipeline
- Baseline logistic regression model implementation and initial evaluation results

### Week 12 (Final Presentation):
- Finalize Random Forest implementation and perform hyperparameter tuning
- Comprehensive evaluation and feature importance analysis
- Prepare and deliver final Jupyter notebook and documented Python package

This proposal outlines a clear path towards developing an impactful predictive healthcare tool, providing valuable learning and practical experiences in machine learning and healthcare applications.
